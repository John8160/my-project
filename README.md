My proggram is a funny game called hilo in which the player guesses if the up coming cad is higher or lower, with the folowing explanations:
First, we need to import the 'random' module to be able to randomly select the winning number.
This line will set the variable 'correct' to be equal to a random integer between 1 and 13

we need a loop that will continue until the user has guessed correctly, the code will run to high if a player guesses high 
and lower if the player guesses the lower one
